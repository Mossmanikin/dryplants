-- In case you don't wanna have errors:

-- Only change what's behind a "=" (or "--"). 
-- Don't use caps (behind a "=").

-- If there's a "false" (behind a "=") you can change it to "true" (and the other way around).
-- Spelling is important.
-- If "true" or "false" is necessary as setting, everything(!) which is not spelled "true" will be read as if it were "false" (even "1", "True"...)

-- If you wanna comment something (for example to remember the default value), you can do this by putting "--" in front of the comment.
-- You can put "--" at the end of a line with "=" in it, or at the beginning of an empty/new line (minetest will ignore what's behind it then).
-- But don't put "--" in front of a line with "=" in it (or else minetest will ignore the setting and you might get an error).

-- If something is still unclear, don't hesitate to post your question @ https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=7143
